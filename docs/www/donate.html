Analysis Situs is a non-sponsored project being developed by a small research group in their spare time.
This project has its own expenses the primary sources of whose are:

<ul>
  <li>Web hosting.
  <li>Attending conferences as we think that is the best way to expose the development results (and, yeah, conferences are <i>very</i> expensive as they require flights/petrol, lodging, and fees; not to mention that all fun is held during the vacations of the involved persons).
</ul>

You can support the project by donating to the corresponding <a href="https://paypal.me/sergeyssv">PayPal account</a>.
