<h1>Imperative plotter</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
The imperative plotter (or visual debugger) is the abstract interface available together with
a progress notifier in all algorithms of Analysis Situs. This interface is designed to easily
dump geometric primitives in cout-like manner right into a 3D viewer for fast check of the
state of your algorithms. The necessity to have visual debuggers is very well understood by
the computer graphics community and by anyone who ever implemented any non-trivial geometric
computations. Just like having all sorts of "Watch" views or printing diagnostic outputs,
the availability of a plotter to dump your geometric primitives is indispensable for understanding
computation flow and debugging.
</p>

<p>
The idea of ​​imperative visualization assumes that at an arbitrary stage of the algorithm, any geometric
primitive involved in it can be displayed for profiling. An example of imperative visualization logic
is presented in a pseudo-code below:
</p>

<div class="code"><pre>{
  // ...
  // Here goes some code to build two surfaces S1 and S2
  // ...

  IV.DRAW_SURFACE(S1)
  IV.DRAW_SURFACE(S2)

  // ...
  // Here goes some code to intersect two surfaces S1 and S2
  // ...

  IV.CLEAN
  IV.DRAW_CURVE(intersection_curve)
}
</pre></div>

<p>
In the above snippet, object IV represents a plotter. It makes sense to keep imperative calls even if
profiling is disabled. This way, you ensure that during the maintenance phase, you will have all necessary
diagnostic dumps in your code.
</p>

<p>
Unlike general visualization workflow, the imperative plotting does not bother you with such notions as
a scene tree, the lifecycle of your rendered primitives, and their states. Programmatically, to draw
a primitive from the algorithm should be as easy as to print a diagnostic message. On the other hand,
the actual implementations of the plotter interface may use any internal structuring of the visualized
objects and maintain their properties so that you may change them later on. A good imperative visualization
should simulate a whiteboard where you can draw and erase whatever you want at any moment of time. It gives you
essentially a <i>cognitive visualization</i> tool which significantly speeds up the development and
debugging routines.
</p>

<p>
The abstract interface of imperative plotter declares the methods like <span class="code-inline">DRAW something</span>
and <span class="code-inline">REDRAW something</span>. It is assumed that the DRAW-methods create new visualization
primitives while the REDRAW-methods update the existing ones (or create them if such primitives are not yet available).
The primitives are identified by their names.
</p>

<p>
Attributes, such as color or transparency, are not configured separately, but are specified for each object individually at the time of drawing.
Thus, the "brush" metaphor is not used here to relieve the imperative principle from having any sort of "memory".
All properties of the visualized primitive should be fully defined by the arguments of a drawing call.
The use of naming makes the profiled algorithm "speak its own language" which is defined as a set of variable names
that might be dumped into explicit geometric representations.
</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>
The abstract interface of imperative plotter is declared in <span class="code-inline">ActAPI_IAlgorithm</span>
class which is a part of <a href="https://gitlab.com/ssv/active-data">Active Data</a> framework. The algorithms
of Analysis Situs inherit from this base class to take advantage of the imperative plotting services.
</p>

<p>
The implementation of the imperative plotter interface in Analysis Situs is available in its <span class="code-inline">asiUI_IV</span>
class (IV = Imperative Viewer). This class overrides all virtual methods of an abstract plotter and delegates the visualization job to VTK
visualization. The visualization mechanics of the imperative plotter fully respects the common
<a href="./features_architecture.html">visualization architecture</a>. Each dumped primitive corresponds to a data object
stored under the common root of <span class="code-inline">asiData_IVNode</span> class. There are several predefined Node types
corresponding to all commonly used primitives:
<ol>
  <li>Point set: <span class="code-inline">asiData_IVPointSetNode</span>.</li>
  <li>Point set 2D: <span class="code-inline">asiData_IVPointSet2dNode</span>.</li>
  <li>Curve: <span class="code-inline">asiData_IVCurveNode</span>.</li>
  <li>Curve 2D: <span class="code-inline">asiData_IVCurve2dNode</span>.</li>
  <li>Surface: <span class="code-inline">asiData_IVSurfaceNode</span>.</li>
  <li>Tessellation: <span class="code-inline">asiData_IVTessItemNode</span>.</li>
  <li>B-Rep model: <span class="code-inline">asiData_IVTopoItemNode</span>.</li>
  <li>Text: <span class="code-inline">asiData_IVTextItemNode</span>.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<div align="center"><img src="../imgs/iv-object-browser.png"/></div>

<p>
All Nodes representing the IV primitives are available in a dedicated section of the project tree. Therefore, the user
is able to manipulate with these primitives if necessary.
</p>

<p>
The imperative plotter is another tool from a gentleman's set of a computational geometer. In essence, this is more of
a practice, the adherence to which helps in the development and maintenance of industrial algorithms.
