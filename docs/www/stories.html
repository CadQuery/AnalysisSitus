Analysis Situs has been used by many independent researchers and organizations. We continue collecting
the feedback, which people sporadically share with us. Without mentioning the names and going into deep
details, here we list the application areas where Analysis Situs appeared to be useful:
<ul>
  <li><b>[Modeling, Visualization]</b> Studying lattice structures filling the solid bodies for 3D printing.
      Analysis Situs was helpful as it provides a ready-to-use integration between OpenCascade and VTK.</li>
  <li><b>[AAG]</b> Recognition of features with AAG. The adjacency graph constructed by Analysis Situs was exported
      to MATLAB for solving the graph isomorphism problem. At the time being, Analysis Situs is
      the only open-source framework for graph-based feature recognition.</li>
  <li><b>[CAD platform]</b> Analysis Situs was used as an open-source CAD platform for CAD model inspection
      and feature recognition prior to manufacturing. In this story, the entire framework, including algorithms,
      data model, UI controls, and scripting, was dynamically linked with a derived application. The target
      system was containerized under Linux to build up a microservice.</li>
</ul>
