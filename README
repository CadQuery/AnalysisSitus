===============================================================================

Analysis Situs is the former name for Topology. Henri Poincare wrote an
original paper on the subject in 1895 where he introduced the fundamental
concepts of the new branch of mathematics. The topological language has appeared
to be extremely useful in Computer-Aided Design field. Tons of research papers
ever published on the subject took advantage of the topological formalism to
construct the mathematical models of the studied subjects.

We think that Analysis Situs is a good name for software which dives into
low-level details of geometric modeling. You load a model to inquire what is
inside. You can study it face-by-face in a CAD-neutral environment. You can look
at your model as a composition of surface patches trimmed by contours. Also, you
can extend the software with your tools as the architecture is quite simple.

Several decades ago there was a CAD system PADL connecting academia with industry.
Practice shows that such a combination of the academic roots playing on the industrial
ground is somewhat very fruitful. Pioneer researchers like A. Requicha who participated
in PADL brought a lot of new seminal concepts to the field (for this A. Requicha and
H. Voelcker got Pierre Bezier Award). So we have a good story to tell and an excellent
example of how things can work. Analysis Situs has nothing to do with PADL and all
these brilliant researchers. However, there is still the same idea to have a link between
academia and real life. In such a setting, Analysis Situs serves as a prototyping tool.
