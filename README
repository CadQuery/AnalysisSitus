Analysis Situs software is aimed to assist developers who use OpenCascade or
other CAD modeling libraries. You can benefit from this software if:

- you're a computational geometer, and you need an ecosystem to prototype and
  profile your algos.

- you're OpenCascade user or developer, and you need a handy tool to inspect
  your geometries.

Some real examples of its usage are as follows:

ex 01. Implement Feature Recognition and Suppression utilities. If you're
       working in this field, then you normally need to inspect CAD models
       closely: find faces and edges, check their types, analyze their
       geometries, etc.

ex 02. Implement Reverse Engineering utilities. If you're working in this
       field, you need to study differential properties of your geometries,
       reconstruct valid topologies, etc.

ex 03. Implement custom geometric modeling algorithms.

Analysis Situs is yet another tool to drop into your CAD geometer's tool box.
The idea is to simplify your daily geometrical challenges, and let you focus
on your particular problems.

Release notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.1.2, 16 December 2016
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Add AAG and topology graphs with visualization.
- Add dihedral angle checker.
- Add non-manifold edges checker.
- Add tools to detach (break sharing info) and kill faces.
- Fix visualization bug with incorrect feeding of face selection pipeline.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.1.1, 14 December 2016
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Experimental version of adaptive center of rotation (there is a problem with
  discontinuity at rotation start). Center of rotation is changed by overriding
  the focal point of the camera and repositioning window center.
- Cosmetic changes in UI: reordering buttons.

Analysis Situs is the former name for Topology. Henri Poincare wrote an
original paper on the subject in 1895 where he introduced the fundamental
concepts of the new branch of mathematics. The topological language has appeared
to be extremely useful in Computer-Aided Design field. Tons of research papers
ever published on the subject took advantage of the topological formalism to
construct the mathematical models of the studied subjects.

We think that Analysis Situs is a good name for a software which dives into
low-level details of geometric modeling. You load a model to inquire what is
inside. You can study it face-by-face in a CAD-neutral environment. You can look
at your model as a composition of surface patches trimmed by contours. And you
can also extend the software with your tools as the architecture is incredibly
simple.

The software relies on the following essential components:

- Active Data for organizing the data of the application hierarchically.
- Quaoar for some CAGD primitives and algorithms.
- Eigen for linear algebra.
- Qt for user interfaces.
- VTK for visualization.
- OpenCascade for CAD geometry.

Analysis Situs allows working with the CAD geometry approximately at the same level
as the OpenCascade's DRAW tool does. However, Analysis Situs is not designed to
substitute DRAW even in plain geometric workflows. DRAW is an entry point to OpenCascade.
Analysis Situs is not. Either it is not a CAD system (heaven forbid). It is a tool for
geometric modeling developers, learners, and researchers.

Several decades ago there was a CAD system PADL connecting the academia with industry.
Practice shows that such a combination of the academic roots playing on the industrial
ground is somewhat very fruitful. Pioneer researchers like A. Requicha who participated
in PADL brought a lot of new seminal concepts to the field (for this A. Requicha and
H. Voelcker got Pierre Bezier Award). So we have a good story to tell and a good
example of how things can work. Analysis Situs has nothing to do with PADL and all
these brilliant researchers. But there is still the same idea to have a link between
the academia and the real life. In such setting, Analysis Situs serves as a prototyping tool.
