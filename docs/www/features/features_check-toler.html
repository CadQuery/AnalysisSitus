Geometric modeling kernels, such as OpenCascade or Parasolid, implement "tolerant modeling" approach.
I.e., instead of using a global geometric inaccuracy, each boundary element (vertex, edge and face)
has its own associated imprecision value called [geometric] tolerance.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Tolerant modeling is a foundation on which reliable solid modeling can be built.
By attaching local tolerances to faces, edges and vertices, the boolean algorithm can
perform intersections and coincidence tests to appropriate tolerances, and take advantage
of a richer structure to represent the resulting solid."
<a href="../references.html#jackson-1995">[Jackson, 1995]</a>

A visually fine B-Rep model may contain significant geometric flaws like small gaps between faces or
wild parameterization of curves. Since what you see on a display is not the real shape but only
its faceted approximation, such imperfections remain hidden unless your modeling engine suddenly
stops working on downstream operations. Geometric inaccuracy is a nightmare for modeling operators.
While there is a certain challenge in how (and to which extent) to maintain tight geometric tolerances,
the must-have feature which is relatively easy to implement is the visual checker of those tolerances.
The idea is to colorize the boundary elements with respect to their local tolerances. The obtained color
mapping gives a good insight on how watertight your model is.
</p>

<p>
To check tolerances in Analysis Situs, you may use command <span class="code-inline">check-toler</span>.
This command creates a certain number of tolerance intervals to colorize the shape. "Warmer"
colors mean less accuracy of the corresponding boundary elements.

Whether your tolerances are Ok or not is a tricky question. It has been agreed quite a while ago that
the consistency of tolerance definition can be discussed only in the context of a specific application
(for reference, see the panel discussion at <a href="../references.html#hoschek-1991">[Hoschek, 1991, pp. 264-265]</a>).
The whole idea of CAD is not to generate mathematically ideal shapes but to make those shapes serve
the industry. Therefore, quite often even poor tolerances are anough to mill a part or to generate a
finite element model. However, you may face unpredictable problems down the road, e.g., when
communicating your CAD model to another software. Thus, even though no model is perfect, it is
practically more safe to have as tight geometric tolerances as possible.
