<p>
The visualization engine of Analysis Situs is designed to be tolerant to possible anomalies in the
CAD model definition. Since the number of possible geometric flaws in boundary representation is literally
countless, it is important to cope with them, and, whenever reasonable, to draw the user's attention to
the detected problems. According to <a href="../references.html#requicha-1980">[Requicha, 1980]</a>,
a mathematical model of a rigid solid body is a bounded, closed, regular, semianalythic subset
of a three-dimensional space. Such an abstract entity is called an "r-set." This definition has become a
commonly accepted mathematical formalism in the field of engineering geometric modeling. Therefore,
one of the basic requirements for a rigid solid is closeness. In the boundary representation scheme,
closeness of a body can be seen at different levels.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>At the level of a solid body (in 3D), closeness means no missing faces (i.e., no "naked" edges).</li>
  <li>At the level of a single face (in 2D), closeness means no gaps in its contour.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Both properties are checked automatically on CAD model import. The shaded visualization of a model starts
with preparation of facets, i.e., the triangles to be passed to the graphics device for rendering. However,
if Analysis Situs finds that some face is not closed, it does not attempt to draw its facets. Instead, the
host surface is visualized with isoparametric lines.

<p>
The closeness check is done in the parametric domain (UV space) of each face. Not only geometric properties are
taken into account. The coincidence test is done using the local tolerances of the face. The orientation of
edges in the contour loop is also important: those contours having inconsistent orientation of edges are
recognized as not closed.
