<p>
To rebuild an edge by re-intersecting its neighbor faces, use <span class="code-inline">rebuild-edge</span>
command. Analysis Situs will analyze the local topological condition around the edge trying to find
the support faces to intersect (faces <span class="code-inline">s1</span> and <span class="code-inline">s2</span> in the following figure).
</p>

<div align="center"><img src="../imgs/rebuild_edge_01.png"/></div>

<p>
As the figure above shows, the normal situation is to have ten adjacent topological
elements for the edge in question (denoted as <span class="code-inline">s1-s2</span>).
This tuple of ten boundary elements we call a <i>topological condition</i> which requires
a certain <i>geometric resolution</i>. It is assumed that resolution does not change the topology
of the model. If any topological changes are required, consider
applying <a href="./features_euler-ops.html">Euler operators</a>.
</p>

<p>
Faces <span class="code-inline">s1</span> and <span class="code-inline">s2</span>
are chosen w.r.t. the orientation of the target edge. The face which contains
a coedge oriented equally with <span class="code-inline">s1-s2</span> edge is chosen
as <span class="code-inline">s1</span> without reducing the generality. The vertex
<span class="code-inline">s1-s2-t1</span> is chosen as the first vertex of the edge
<span class="code-inline">s1-s2</span>. The vertex <span class="code-inline">s1-s2-t2</span>
is chosen as the last vertex of the edge <span class="code-inline">s1-s2</span>.
</p>

<p>
The process of edge rebuilding employs recomputation of its host curve and extremities
(i.e. vertices). However, in some circumstances you may know a priori that
no recomputation is necessary for certain vertex positions. This knowledge
can be taken into account in the algorithm by specifying the so called "frozen"
vertices. Let's expand a bit on why this possibility is important.
A vertex is generally recomputed using <i>curve-surface intersection algorithm</i>.
However, if the intersection operands are not in general position
(see <a href="../references.html#barnhill-1987">[Barnhill et al, 1987]</a> for
the discussion of "general position" term in the context of intersection), the
recomputation routine is likely to fail or give inaccurate results. The figure below
illustrates two situations which are tricky to resolve. In the fist figure, the
intersection point was not found because of small proximity between the operands.
Such a proximity has no sense from the engineering point of view as most likely the
geometries are meant to be tangent. The next figure illustrates a possible result
of intersection if the operand curve is pulled a bit closer to the surface. We see
multiple intersection points (none is accurate) while only one point is actually
meant there.

<p>
The best practice in geometric modeling is to identify special cases of intersection to enable
specific treatment for them. Since multiple intersection points may emerge in tangential cases, the
<span class="code-inline">rebuild-edge</span> command attempts to average the
obtained points to produce a single result out of them. However, this technique is error-prone as
it does not guarantee that the average point is more accurate than any of the contributing coordinates. In
practice, it is much better just to avoid recomputation of intersections as much as possible
(and especially in non-general-position cases). The possibility to specify the "frozen" vertices
enables the principle known as "knowledge-guided computation" (see <a href="../references.html#piegl-2005">[Piegl, 2005]</a>
for a comprehensive discussion of robustness issues in CAD).
</p>

<div class="note">
One practical example where "frozen" vertices are used is a blends suppression algorithm. In this algorithm,
the edge <span class="code-inline">s1-s2</span> represents the collapsed blend face, and the edges
<span class="code-inline">s1-t1</span>, <span class="code-inline">s2-t1</span>, <span class="code-inline">s1-t2</span>
and <span class="code-inline">s2-t2</span> require recomputation. Each of the latter edges has one vertex which does
not require recomputation.
